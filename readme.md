1. 7kyu ~ String matchup

Given two arrays of strings, return the number of times each string of the second array appears in the first array.

Example
array1 = ['abc', 'abc', 'xyz', 'cde', 'uvw']
array2 = ['abc', 'cde', 'uap']
How many times do the elements in array2 appear in array1?

'abc' appears twice in the first array (2)
'cde' appears only once (1)
'uap' does not appear in the first array (0)
Therefore, solve(array1, array2) = [2, 1, 0]

2. 8 kyu ~ Value in Array

You will be given an array a and a value x. All you need to do is check whether the provided array contains the value.

Array can contain numbers or strings. X can be either.

Return true if the array contains the value, false if not.

3. 8 kyu ~ Triple Trouble

Create a function that will return a string that combines all of the letters of the three inputed strings in groups. Taking the first letter of all of the inputs and grouping them next to each other. Do this for every letter, see example below!

E.g. Input: "aa", "bb" , "cc" => Output: "abcabc"

Note: You can expect all of the inputs to be the same length.
